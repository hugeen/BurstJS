# BurstJS

Event-Driven HTML5 Game Framework

## BurstJS is:

* Still in *draft* form
* Only compatible on modern browsers (*IE10+*, *Webkit*, ...)
* Designed with an *innovative* approach: [The **MEC** Pattern](https://github.com/hugeen/BurstJS/wiki/The-MEC-Pattern) (*Models/Events/Capabilities*)
* Using the latest **HTML5** technologies, such as *WebGL*, *WebWorkers*, *WebSockets*
* *Open-Source*, *Modular* and *Hackable*
